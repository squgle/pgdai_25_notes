**Advanced Programming Using Python  
PG-DAI February 2025**  

### Duration:  
- **44 Classroom hours** (Theory)  
- **46 Lab hours**  

### Objective:  
To introduce students to Python programming.  

### Prerequisites:  
Knowledge of programming in languages like C or C++ and basic statistical knowledge.  

### Evaluation Method:  
- Theory exam: 40% weightage  
- Lab exam: 40% weightage  
- Internal exam: 20% weightage  

### List of Books / Other Training Material  

#### Courseware:  
*Python For Everybody: Exploring Data In Python 3*, Charles R. Severance  

#### Reference Books:  
1. *Data Wrangling Using Python* by Jacqueline Kazil, Katharine Jarmul  
2. *Introduction to Computer Science Using Python*, Charles/Wiley  
3. *Learn Python the Hard Way*, Zed A. Shaw, Pearson, 2018

#### Notes:  
- Each session consists of **2 hours of Theory (T)** and **2 hours of Lab (L)**.  
- Lab assignments are indicative; faculty should provide adequate practice.  
- At least one lab assignment should be an end-to-end application.
